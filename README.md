# üéÆ Platformer Game #
## - Second Semester Project ##
This repository contains a platformer game developed as a second-semester project by **Mohammed Shehsin Thamarachalil Abdulresak** and **Mateusz Grygiel**. The game is written in **C++ and utilizes the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)** for graphics and audio.

## Game Description ##
The platformer game features a player character that can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. The game consists of multiple platforms, the quantity of which varies based on the chosen difficulty level. Fireballs traverse the screen from left to right, posing a challenge for the player. The primary objective is for the player to avoid these fireballs while navigating the platforms.

To enhance gameplay, gold bags appear at random locations, allowing the player to collect them and earn bounce points. These gold bags are valuable items within the game. However, the player must be cautious, as colliding with a fireball will result in the loss of one life. The player starts the game with three lives.

To mitigate the risk of losing lives, the player can regain health by collecting hearts that appear randomly on the screen. These hearts, however, have a time limit of five seconds before they disappear. The player can only regain health while the hearts are available. If the player loses all three lives, the game ends.

 ## üìñ Instructions ##
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/Mohammed-Shehsin/SFML_Game_Project.git`

Ensure that you have the SFML library installed on your system. Refer to the official SFML documentation for installation instructions: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php

Build the project using a C++ compiler that supports the SFML library. Make sure to link the necessary SFML libraries during the build process.

Launch the game executable after successfully building the project.

Control the player character using the arrow keys or designated movement keys:

‚¨ÜÔ∏è Up: Move up 
‚¨áÔ∏è Down: Move down
‚¨ÖÔ∏è Left: Move left
‚û°Ô∏è Right: Move right
Avoid the üî• fireballs moving from left to right on the screen.

Collect ü™ô gold bags to earn bounce points and increase your score.

Collect ‚ù§Ô∏è hearts to regain health within the given time limit.

Play strategically and aim to survive as long as possible.

##üßë‚Äçüíª Development Team ##
This project was developed by **Mohammed Shehsin Thamarachalil Abdulresak and Mateusz Grygiel** as part of the second-semester coursework. We collaborated closely, sharing ideas and responsibilities to create an enjoyable platformer game.

## Future Enhancements ##
Although the game is functional, there are opportunities for future improvements and additions, including:

Adding different levels with increasing difficulty.
Incorporating power-ups or additional items to enhance gameplay.
Implementing sound effects and background music.
Enhancing the game's visual aesthetics with improved graphics and animations.
Feel free to contribute to the project by implementing any of these enhancements or by addressing any identified issues.
